## üìù Description

This is our group's submisssion to our coding bootcamp's second mini project. The brand "Lakbay" as well as the website's brief and functions are created by the developers for the sole purpose of this project. It is not a real company and does not operate in the real world. For the front-end, we utilized ReactJS with Vite, and for the backend, we used nodejs, creating this fullstack website.

### About the Brand

Lakbay is a Filipino travel agency which showcases various tourist spots in the Philippines and offers transportation and guiding services to customers. Their tours which lasts from half - 3 days focus on one primary destination (e.g. Puerto Princesa Underground River) and some nearby locations as secondary.

Their target audience is mainly young adventurous adults from both local and international. The clients want to have a website that feels modern, exquisite/elegant, trustworthy, safe, and emphasizes the beauty of the country.

### Website Features

The website should have the following features/sections:

- 5 main destination categories or themes (water, mountains, city, historical, nature)
- A page describing the main destinations (at least 3 in each theme) + secondary locations
- Log in and Sign Up membership system
- A tour booking system in each destination
- A member-exclusive account page
- A travel agent-exclusive dashboard
- An admin-exclusive dashboard
- A "Share your story" section in each destination showcasing the experiences of past customers instead of testimonials
